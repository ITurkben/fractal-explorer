## The Mathematics

### Mandelbrot Set

The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers **c** for which the sequence

> z₀ = 0,   z_{n+1} = z_n² + c

remains **bounded** (does not escape to infinity). Points inside the set are colored black; points outside are colored by how quickly they escape — creating the iconic infinitely detailed boundary.

**Smooth coloring:** instead of counting discrete iterations, we use the normalized escape count:

> μ = n + 1 − log₂(log₂|z_n|)

This removes the visible "staircase" banding of raw iteration counts.

### Julia Sets

A Julia set uses the same iteration **z_{n+1} = z_n² + c**, but **c is a fixed constant** and the initial value **z₀ = pixel coordinate**. Each choice of c produces a different shape — ranging from connected "dendrites" to totally disconnected "dust." The two sliders (or Alt+mouse) let you explore this parameter space in real time.

### Burning Ship

A variation of Mandelbrot where the absolute values of the real and imaginary parts are taken before each squaring:

> z_{n+1} = (|Re(z_n)| + i|Im(z_n)|)² + c

The result looks like a burning ship viewed from below, with self-similar flames along the hull.

### Newton Fractal

Applies Newton's root-finding method to **f(z) = z³ − 1**:

> z_{n+1} = z_n − f(z_n)/f′(z_n) = (2z_n³ + 1) / (3z_n²)

The three roots of z³ = 1 are:
- **1**
- **ω = e^(2πi/3) ≈ −0.5 + 0.866i**
- **ω² = e^(4πi/3) ≈ −0.5 − 0.866i**

Each pixel is colored by which root the iteration converges to (blue / green / red) and how many iterations it took (brightness). The resulting fractal is a mesmerizing trichromatic basin boundary.

## Deep Zoom & Precision

Standard single-precision floats have ~7 significant decimal digits — enough for zoom levels up to ~10⁷ before pixelation appears. To support deeper exploration, this explorer implements **double-float emulation** directly in GLSL:

Each coordinate is represented as **two 32-bit floats** `(hi, lo)` such that the true value ≈ hi + lo. Arithmetic (Veltkamp-Dekker algorithm) preserves this invariant through addition and multiplication, yielding ~14 significant digits — matching IEEE 754 double precision on the CPU.

## Tech Stack

- **WebGL 2 / GLSL ES 3.00** — GPU rendering (mandatory; CPU would be too slow)
- **Vanilla JS** — zero frameworks, zero dependencies
- **Single `index.html`** — no build step required
- **GitHub Actions** — automatic deploy to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`

---

## Local Development

```bash
# Any static server works — no build step needed
npx serve .
# or
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.
